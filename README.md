> I developed the backend microservice using .NET 6<br> Also, a few unit tests were developed for testing the calculation.

```
dotnet ef migrations add "InitDatatbase" -o "Data/Migrations" -c "WorkloadCalculatorDbContext" -p ./src/AIHR.WorkloadCalculator.Service/AIHR.WorkloadCalculator.Service.csproj


dotnet ef database update  -c "WorkloadCalculatorDbContext" -p ./src/AIHR.WorkloadCalculator.Service/AIHR.WorkloadCalculator.Service.csproj

# Coding Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to create a Workload Calculator. With the microservice, the end-user can select which courses from our curriculum they want to take and theyâ€™ll get their workload (expected study hours per week) to finish theirlearning journey on time.

## Instructions:

* You can use any of the following programming languages: C#, NodeJS, or Python.

* An interface (UI) is required, but we are not looking for a perfect designed UI/UX front end, if you are more comfortable with a console app, use that instead

  

## Specs:

* Create a list of courses that shows the course's name and duration (in hours) where the user can multi-select which one they wish to take (see below the list of courses and their respective completion hours)

* Create a form where the user can select Start and End dates

* Create a Calculate button

* The final output needs to show how many hours the student needs to study per week to complete all selected courses afterthey click the Calculate button

* The list of selected courses, the Start and End dates, and the finalresult needs to be stored in a database

* Display the usage history forthe calculator based on the student's inputs
